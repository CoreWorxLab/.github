# CoreWorxLab

Building in public: AI, homelab, and DIY projects.

## About

This is the GitHub home for projects built on the [CoreWorxLab YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@CoreWorxLab). Some repos are companions to videos, others are standalone tools extracted from larger projects.

**What we build:**
- **AI & Voice** - Local-first voice assistants, speech pipelines, agent frameworks
- **Homelab & Self-hosting** - Infrastructure, servers, automation
- **DIY & Hardware** - Physical builds, electronics, maker projects

Everything here is built in public. Follow along, use what's useful, contribute if you'd like.
